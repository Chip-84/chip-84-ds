# Chip-84 DS 
A port of [Chip-84](https://github.com/ckosmic/chip-84), a CHIP-8 and SUPERCHIP-8 emulator/interpreter to the NDS.

## Building
To build Chip-84 DS, first install [libNDS](https://devkitpro.org/wiki/Getting_Started) from devkitPro.  Then run make in the project's directory or run build.bat.

## Instructions
Load Chip84DS.nds onto a flashcart.  In game, your flashcart's filesystem will appear where you can enter directories and choose a CHIP-8 or SCHIP-8 ROM using up and down and A to select an entry.  When the game starts, use the touchscreen to control the game (yeah it's pretty bad right now) and press start to exit the game.
